## April 4 Meeting

### "Why Should I Trust You?": Explaining the Predictions of Any Classifier
Marco Tulio Ribeiro, Sameer Singh, Carlos Guestrin

[arXiv link][paper]

### Timeline
* Everybody read the paper properly
* Joey: read other papers, start structuring the report, write some related work stuff, motivation, main question
* Nikhil: read related works
* Mansha: get familiar with code, try different datasets

### Main Idea
Reproduce examples in the paper with different datasets (TBD) and investigate the case where we want to highlight what went wrong in a classification (instead of what went right).
For instance, when classifying an image, we want to visualize the algorithm's preferences for this particular picture.
